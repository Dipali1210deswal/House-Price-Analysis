# House Price Prediction




## 1. Objective
The primary goal of this project is to predict house prices using machine learning techniques.
By the end of this project, you should be able to preprocess data, select and apply suitable
machine learning algorithms, and evaluate the performance of your model.
## 2. Dataset 
here i have used the "Ames Housing Dataset," which includes various features affecting house
prices. The dataset is available at Kaggle: Ames Housing Dataset.
## 3. Tools and frameworks
1. Python: The primary programming language for this project.
2. Jupyter Notebook: For interactive coding and visualization.
3. Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
4. NumPy: For numerical operations.
5. Scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics.
6. Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
## 4. Steps 
1. Data Collection and Understanding
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Model Selection and Training
5. Model Evaluation
6. Model Interpretation and Visualization
